      "faceText": "What is the rule of 12-ths?",
      "flippedFaceText": "Important when navigating a boat in tidal waters. Take the difference in height between the high and low tide on that day, and divide that by 12 equal chunks. For example, if high tide was 8ft above chart datum, and low is 2ft above chart datum – there is a 6ft difference, divided that into 12 even chunks; equaling 0.5ft per chunk.What we then do is assume that there is a 6 hour gap between high and low tide; although not completely accurate, it is close enough for what we are attempting here. So starting at low tide: The first hour, 1 twelfth of the tide would rise; so one chunk would come in, 0.5 ft.The second hour, 2 twelfths of the total will come in, therefore 1 ft. The third hour, the tide is starting to move quickly, and so 3 twelfths will come on, therefore 1.5ft. At this point we are now passing mid tide. The fourth hour again is 3 twelfths, so another 1.5ft. The fifth hour the tide slows down again, 2 twelfths, therefore 1ft. The sixth and final hour, 1 twelfth would come in, and therefore 0.5ft. The tide would then drop following the same pattern."
